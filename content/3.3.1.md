# Search Algorithms and Search Trees

A search algorithm takes a search problem as input and returns either a solution or an indication of failure. In this chapter, we explore algorithms that superimpose a **search tree** over the **state space graph**, forming various paths from the initial state and attempting to reach a goal state. In this structure, each **node** in the search tree represents a **state** in the state space, while each **edge** corresponds to an **action**. The **root** of the tree signifies the **initial state** of the problem.

## State Space vs. Search Tree

The **state space** refers to the (possibly infinite) collection of states and the actions that enable transitions between them. In contrast, the **search tree** outlines the paths connecting these states, guiding the search toward the goal. While the search tree may contain multiple paths to the same state resulting in multiple nodes for that state each node maintains a unique path back to the root.

## Example: Arad to Bucharest

To illustrate, consider the task of finding a path from **Arad** to **Bucharest**. The root node of the search tree is **Arad**. To expand this node, we examine the available **actions**, apply the **RESULT** function to determine the resulting states, and generate **child nodes** for each of these outcomes. For instance, the resulting states might include **Sibiu**, **Timisoara**, and **Zerind**.

## Frontier of the Search Tree

Next, we must decide which child node to expand suppose we choose **Sibiu**. This expansion yields a set of **unexpanded nodes**, collectively known as the **frontier**. Any state for which a node has been generated is considered **reached**, regardless of whether it has been expanded.

## Frontier Regions

The **frontier** serves as a boundary between two regions in the state-space graph. The **interior region** consists of states that have already been expanded, while the **exterior region** includes states that have not yet been reached.
