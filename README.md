  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Iterative Deepening Search
  - Dijkstra’s Algorithm

- 🎨 **Interactive Interfaces**  
  Visualize how each algorithm expands nodes, builds search trees, and finds paths.

- ⚡ **Built with React + Vite**  
  Fast development environment with modular, scalable components.
